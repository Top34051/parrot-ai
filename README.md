Parrot.Ai is a web application that allows users to complete a form without having to read and write by themselves. It will navigate users through the form and fill out each question in a conversation-like manner.

Our application extracts information–including titles, descriptions, and options–from a given Google form and renders them for the user to interact with. We choose Google Forms because it is simple and effective. The application consists of two main components: frontend and backend.

## Run the Application

Please check `frontend/` and `backend/` directory out for more details on how to run frontend and backend side of the application.
