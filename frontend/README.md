# Parrot.AI Frontend Application

The frontend side–implemented using Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and webpack–is responsible for rendering interactable visual elements and performing client-side logic. We choose Next.js due to future support for SSR and better SEO. We are using React for simplicity in implementing interactions with users and easy migration to react-native for mobile apps support in future. The website supports audio recording and calls the backend API to perform more complicated tasks, if necessary.
